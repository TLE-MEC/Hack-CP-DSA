## Kadane's Algorithm 
# Problem Statement
Given an array Arr[] of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array(containing at least one number) which has the maximum sum and return its sum.


Example 1:

Input:

    N = 5
    Arr[] = {1,2,3,-2,5}

Output:
     
     9

Explanation:
Max subarray sum is 9 of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which is a contiguous subarray.


Example 2:

Input:

    N = 4
    Arr[] = {-1,-2,-3,-4}
    
Output:

    -1

Explanation:
Max subarray sum is -1 
of element (-1)

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function maxSubarraySum() which takes Arr[] and N as input parameters and returns the sum of subarray with maximum sum.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


**Constraints:**

1 ≤ N ≤ 106

-107 ≤ A[i] ≤ 107
