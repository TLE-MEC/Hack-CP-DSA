A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`
*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```
